// Movement Script for the camera: 
// Middle Mouse + Movement => Panning following the camera's plane
// Right Mouse + Movement => Rotation with a point on the ground close to the middle of the screen
// Buttons on the UI => Zoom in and out
// Not using the scroll wheel because it's linked to "rotating a block when placing it" already


// Why not use a Cinemachine? It has a way to move using inputs!
// Because I want the inputs to be only activated when pressing a button
// This is not possible with the new input system, even if we have what's called Modifiers

// Modifiers are "only register the input if I recieve both inputs", which is pretty useful for shortcut creation
// Example: Input "save" as S with Modifier Ctrl:   In code, the event "Save" will only get Invoked when Ctrl AND S are pressed at once

// Why can't I use it with the cinemachine then? Because the inputs then can "let pass" are limited to buttons and floats
// However I want to have Vector2 (mouse position delta), so I need to code the whole thing myself.
