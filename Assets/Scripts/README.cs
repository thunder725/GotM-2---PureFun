        Hello Ga√©tan.

        You're probably reading through the project's code to see how it's done.

        Needless to say this project is unfinished because the scope was WAY too high for my level,
    but at least I learned a LOOOOOT of things like :
            - Built-in drag & drop with IDragHandler that I ended up scrapping because it didn't fit with the project,
            - How to create assembly references for custom packages (that I'm using for my Demoreel project),
            - How to use Raycasts as well as RaycastHits, and how to do raycasts on UI (which is a nightmare),
            - Scriptable Objects as a way to store data like a dictionnary without having to store it in a scene,
            - How to get the mouse's position in data and use it for raycasting and manual drag & drop,
            - How to have clearer scripts and comments everywhere because coming back to a big script after 2 weeks is HARD
            - That Unity apparently has something called a Singleton... so I don't need to code it myself? But too late to implement it
            - And a lot of other things, but this list is becoming pretty long.

        The whole "level builder" took so much time to think about and implement that the actual fun part of the game
    couldn't be done in time, like tubes that are ramps that launch the marble away with particles and a path pre-visualizer.

        So it means that for a "pure fun game that is more a toy than anything else", it's not that fitting.
    The game is not fun to play as because you have so little to do, and the actual "See the marble" part doesn't feel good enough.

        But if the goal of those projects is to experiment and learn new things in code and design, I'd consider it mission accomplished.
    Not only did I learn a lot of things coding-wise, I stepped outside of my confort zone because an entire Level Builder is not something
    I thought I could do in under a month (let's be real I didn't work on it everyday, I also focused on the demoreel or the collaborative game a lot).
    So that's reassuring: I'm capable of doing something complicated if needed; even if the code is pretty messy at the end...

        TL;DR: It was fun to do, probably not to play... My bad
